#### Brief description of myself

I’m a QA engineer with 7 years of experience. In this period I’ve enjoyed both the challenge of thinking the product from a different point of view, and how a good test strategy can save time, effort and money to your team, other teams, and the company itself. 

Teamwork and communication between different roles is key for the product's quality. I love to share knowledge and points of view about the code, ways of working and quality with my team mates. I also enjoy helping the team and getting help from them to increase quality both in the project and in the processes. 

In a near future I would like to keep learning new testing methods and tools, and expanding my knowledge to other testing areas where I’ve not worked that much, such as performance, load or mobile apps testing.
