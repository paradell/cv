Use github to contact me. Open an issue or a PR and it will ring a bell !

I started as a QA just after college, and in these 11 years I've been contributing and learning in several projects. My career has been pivoting into analyzing the core areas of the products, and defining and implementing the automated tests that could make an impact in the development cycle. Teamwork and communication between different roles is key for the product's quality, and to involve every team member to take ownership, in their areas of expertise, of the product quality. The last 4 years, I've gained experience in Big Data, giving and developing ideas of new business in coordination with the end clients. 

This fulfilling Big Data experience has opened the gates of an area where I've enjoyed a lot learning new concepts, using new tools and facing exciting challenges. I see myself in the immediate future keeping in touch with data driven business. And based on the 4 year experience in Big Data, to continue contributing and learning even more in this area, which is crucial in the new digital economies.
