I'm an engineer with Data Engineering and Quality Assurance experience. I like working on projects with impact in people's and clients' lives, overcoming any new challenge that may appear.

In every project I worked on, I've been part of a multidisciplinary team where fluent communication and teamwork were the keys to meet the objectives and deal with the uncertainties. Thanks to these synergies, I've learnt from areas I was not previously confident on, and I've earned an end to end vision of the projects.

My most recent job as Data Engineer was focused on ideating, developing and deploying new business aligned with the final client's needs. I want to keep working on data based business, contributing with my knowledge and experience, facing new challenges, and learning even more about data related areas, which are crucial to the new digital economies.
